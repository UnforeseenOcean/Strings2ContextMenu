# Note about safety
- ALWAYS RENAME EXECUTABLE FILES TO SAFE EXTENSION OR PREVENT EXECUTION.
  - Such as `.exe.vir` or `.cmd.no`
  - I did test the script against many files, but there's no guarantee it's 100% bulletproof
- ALWAYS CHECK FILES BEFORE INSTALLING.
- LOCK THE FILE DOWN TO PREVENT EXECUTABLE SWITCHEROO ATTACK OR SCRIPT INFECTION
  - Utilize Windows' built-in file permissions manager
  - I could not include this edit due to every computer's configuration being different
  - It does pay to check your system regularly for malware, regardless of who you are and how much you know about computer viruses
- TREAT ANY FILE AS HOSTILE UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
